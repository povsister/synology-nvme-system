# Synology NVME System
> Time to "migrate" your DSM to NVME drivers!

## Key features
* Make it possible to "run" DSM on NVME drivers.
* Boost DSM system IO performance.
* Stay sync with HDD disks.
* Reduce HDD noise by less seeking & writing.

## Requirements

Theoretically, all synology models with NVME Storage Pool support are able to
use this tool. But I have only tested it on my DS923+ with DSM 7.2.1-69057.

* A Synology NAS with NVME Storage Pool support is the only thing you need.

I personally recommend those who have the latest DSM installed & 
fresh new synology to try this tool.

### Tested on
